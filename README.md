# Text-Mining-NLP

# This is a comprehensive project covering Data Visualization and Text Analytics.

# The Project uses data from Airbnb dataset. Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily home stays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedand-Breakfast.com. The company has been criticized for possibly driving up home rents and creating nuisances for those living near leased properties. The company is regulated by many jurisdictions, including the European Union and cities such as San Francisco and New York City. It is viewed as a competitive threat by the hotel industry.
